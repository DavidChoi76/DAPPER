# Examples

Here are some example scripts using DAPPER.
They all consist of one (or more) synthetic experiments.

Run them using `python examples/the_script.py`,
or with the `%run` command inside `ipython`.
Some of the scripts have also been converted to Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`).
You can try them out without installing anything
by pressing this button (but note that some plotting features won't work, and that ir requires a Google login): [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/nansencenter/DAPPER) 

## Description

- `basic_1.py`: A single experiment, with Liveplotting.
- `basic_2.py`: Comparison of several DA methods.
- `basic_3.py`: Comparison of *many* DA methods and other experiment settings.
- `param_estim.py`: Similar to `basic_2`, but with parameter estimation.
